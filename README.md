## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing financial analysis using Excel’s built-in financial functions to evaluate investments, loans, and cash flow scenarios.

## Business Use Case
This project helps organizations evaluate investment opportunities, analyze loan repayment structures, and compare financial scenarios using time-value-of-money concepts.

## Project Workflow
1. Reviewed financial concepts and terminologies
2. Analyzed provided financial datasets
3. Applied Excel financial functions for calculations
4. Interpreted results to derive financial insights
5. Summarized findings in a presentation format

## Scope and Objectives
- Perform financial analysis using Excel
- Evaluate investments using PV, NPV, IRR, and MIRR
- Analyze irregular cash flows using XNPV and XIRR
- Understand loan repayment using EMI calculations
